# Carnalitas AGOT Compatibility

This is a [Carnalitas](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14207-carnalitas-unified-sex-mod-framework-for-ck3/) compatibility patch for [A Game of Thrones](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2962333032). It reconciles changes to the character window and other game files made by these two mods. It also adds AGOT lore-based slavery doctrines, similar to the *Carnalitas Historical Slavery Doctrines* mod.

The latest version is compatible with CK3 1.11.x, Carnalitas 2.2, and AGOT 0.2.x.

Load order:

* A Game of Thrones
* Carnalitas
* Carnalitas AGOT Compatibility (this mod)
* (other mods based on Carnalitas)

If you use the slavery system, it is strongly recommended to also use the [Carnalitas Slavery Reimagined](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/25565-carnalitas-slavery-reimagined/) mod that also has a CSR AGOT compatibility patch available as a separate download. The load order in this case should be:

* A Game of Thrones
* Carnalitas
* Carnalitas AGOT Compatibility (this mod)
* Carnalitas Slavery Reimagined
* CSR AGOT Compatibility

## Compatibility Fixes

### Character Window

All changes to the character window made by Carnalitas and AGOT have been reconciled, so that all additional interface elements introduced by both are present. Additional AGOT interface elements such as paramours, squires, and knights, as well as Carnalitas changes such as slaves at the bottom of the *Relations* tab, are all properly shown.

### Interactions and Events

All changes to other vanilla files made by Carnalitas and AGOT have been reconciled. The AGOT files have been taken as base, and Carnalitas changes have been applied on them. The effects are numerous and so are not listed here. One notable effect is that references to vanilla religions, faiths, culture, and titles present in the original Carnalitas no longer fill the logs with error messages.

## Integration with AGOT Slavery System

Starting with version 0.2.0, AGOT introduces its own slavery system. This system is still pretty rudimentary and mostly does not conflict with Carnalitas. This mod does not integrate of change any of its features. A better integration is available in the [CSR AGOT Compatibility](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/25565-carnalitas-slavery-reimagined/) mod.

## Lore-based Slavery Doctrines

This mod introduces a *A Song of Ice and Fire Lore* game rules setting for Carnalitas slavery doctrines, and makes it the default. If this setting is active, all faiths have accurate doctrines for *Righteous Faith Slavery* and *Hostile Faith Slavery* based on A Song of Ice and Fire lore research. The effect is similar to using the *Carnalitas Historical Slavery Doctrines* mod (available as a separate [Carnalitas](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14207-carnalitas-unified-sex-mod-framework-for-ck3/) download) in vanilla.

### Overview

According to [Slavery](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Slavery) and [R'hllor](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/R%27hllor) Wiki pages:

* Both the *Old Gods* and the *Faith of the Seven* hold slavery to be an abomination. I take this to mean that slavery should be criminal in *Faith of the Seven* and *Old Gods* faiths south of the Wall.
* The Ironborn (who are *Drowned God* adherents) keep thralls and salt wives, but don't regard them as slaves. I take this to mean that slavery should be either shunned or accepted in *Drowned God* faiths.
* Some of the wildling clans north of the Wall also practice thralldom. I take this to mean that slavery should be either shunned or accepted in *Old Gods* faiths north of the Wall.
* Slavery was widespread in Old Valyria and still is in the Free Cities, except for Braavos. I take this to mean that slavery should be accepted in *Valyrian* faiths.
* Servants of the Temple of the Lord of Light in Volantis are slaves who were bought as children and trained. I take this to mean that slavery should be accepted in *Dawnbringer* faiths.

There are no explicit mentions of slavery for *Rhyonish* faiths. On one hand they are of Eastern origin, on the other their adherents have historically suffered and fled from enslavement. I take this to mean that slavery should be shunned in *Rhyonish* faiths.

In addition, the AGOT mod has its own slavery mechanics including slavery realm laws, slave buildings, and slave populations. The Free Cities of Lys, Myr, Pentos, and Tyrosh all start with realm laws allowing slavery. I regard this as a confirmation that that slavery should be accepted in religions that are widespread or originating from this part of Essos, which includes all *Valyrian* and *Dawnbringer* faiths.

### Righteous Faith Slavery

The baseline for *Righteous Faith Slavery* depending on religious family is as follows:

* *Faith of the Seven*: criminal
* *Westerosi*: criminal
* *Dawnbringer*: accepted
* *Valyrian*: accepted
* *Rhyonish*: shunned
* *Winter*: accepted

The only exception from the baseline are *Drowned God* faiths and *Old Gods* faiths north of the Wall, where righteous faith slavery is shunned instead of criminal.

### Hostile Faith Slavery

The baseline for *Hostile Faith Slavery* depending on religious family is as follows:

* *Faith of the Seven*: criminal
* *Westerosi*: shunned
* *Dawnbringer*: accepted
* *Valyrian*: accepted
* *Rhyonish*: shunned
* *Winter*: accepted

The exceptions from the baseline are:

* *Old Gods* faiths south of the Wall, where hostile faith slavery is criminal.
* *Drowned God* faiths and *Old Gods* faiths north of the Wall, where it is accepted.

Note that *Hostile Faith Slavery* can never be less accepted than *Righteous Faith Slavery*.
